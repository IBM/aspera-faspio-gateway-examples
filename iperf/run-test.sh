# iperf3 Performance Test Runner
# Simple script to run iperf3 TCP performance tests with optional FASP tunneling
#
# Usage: ./run-test.sh [OPTIONS]
# Examples: 
#   ./run-test.sh         (runs TCP test through FASP tunnel)
#   ./run-test.sh --direct (runs TCP test via direct connection, no tunnel)
# Default: TCP through FASP tunnel
