# FTP Tunneling Test Runner
# Simple script to run the FTP over FASP tunneling demo
#
# Usage: ./run-test.sh [OPTIONS] [file_size_mb]
# Examples: 
#   ./run-test.sh               (downloads 10MB file through FASP tunnel)
#   ./run-test.sh 50            (downloads 50MB file through FASP tunnel)
#   ./run-test.sh --direct      (downloads 10MB file via direct FTP, no tunnel)
#   ./run-test.sh --direct 1    (downloads 1MB file via direct FTP)
# Default: 10MB through FASP tunnel
